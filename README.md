# CardCarton

This is a vector graphic art application extension and, at my option, a stand-alone application to create cartons for packaging.

This is release one; thus, it is a proof of concept that I created while I was exploring the potential of extension frameworks.

I am presently investigating the feasibility of using the same script in multiple applications.
